Clustering life insurance policy holders at Parsian Insurance Company.

During my contribution to Parsian Insurance Coompany, I proposed a clustering
solution to Life Insurance project manager (Mrs.Alimohammadi) to get some insight 
about policy holders.
We selected life policy features, prepared the customers dataset and tried
to get some knowledge.
